    <h1>Privacy Policy for Pet Toxic</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last updated: February 6, 2026</p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Pet Toxic is a reference application designed to help pet owners identify substances that may be harmful to their pets. We are committed to protecting your privacy.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>Pet Toxic does <strong>not</strong> directly collect, store, or transmit any personal information. The app's toxicity database, medical glossary, and lab work reference guide are all bundled within the app and operate entirely offline. The app does not require an account, login, or internet connection to access its content.</p>

    <h2>Data Stored on Your Device</h2>
    <p>The app stores the following data locally on your device only:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your saved/bookmarked articles</li>
        <li>Your recent search history</li>
        <li>Your display preferences (such as light/dark mode)</li>
        <li>Your purchase status (free, Pro, or Supporter tier)</li>
        <li>Pet profiles you create (including pet name, species, breed, weight, date of birth, and optional photo)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This data is stored entirely on your device and is never transmitted to us or any third party. We do not have access to any of this information. You can clear all app data at any time by deleting the app.</p>

    <h2>Advertising</h2>
    <p>The free version of Pet Toxic displays advertisements provided by Google AdMob. This service may collect certain information automatically, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Device identifiers</li>
        <li>General location (city/region level)</li>
        <li>App usage and ad interaction data</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This information is used to serve relevant advertisements and is governed by <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google's Privacy Policy</a>. We do not have access to or control over the data collected by Google AdMob.</p>
    <p>When you first open the app, you may be prompted via Apple's App Tracking Transparency framework to allow or deny tracking for ad personalization. You can change this preference at any time in your device's Settings.</p>
    <p><strong>Ad-Free Experience:</strong> Users who purchase the Pro or Supporter upgrade will not see advertisements, and no ad-related data collection will occur.</p>

    <h2>In-App Purchases</h2>
    <p>Pet Toxic offers optional in-app purchases to unlock additional features and remove advertisements:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Pro:</strong> Removes ads and unlocks My Pets profiles, the Medical Glossary, and the Lab Work Guide.</li>
        <li><strong>Supporter:</strong> Includes everything in Pro, plus a supporter badge. A portion of proceeds supports local animal shelters and rescues.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>All transactions are processed entirely by Apple through the App Store. We do not collect or have access to your payment information.</p>

    <h2>External Links</h2>
    <p>The app provides phone numbers for poison control hotlines. When you tap these numbers, your device's phone app will open. These calls are handled entirely by your device and carrier.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Pet Toxic does not knowingly collect personal information from anyone, including children under 13. The third-party ad network used in the free version may have its own policies regarding children's data.</p>

    <h2>Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have questions about this privacy policy, please contact us at:<br>
    <strong><a href="mailto:support@pettoxic.com">support@pettoxic.com</a></strong></p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the "Last updated" date above.</p>
