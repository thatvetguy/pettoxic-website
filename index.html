    <h1>Privacy Policy for Pet Toxic</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last updated: January 20, 2026</p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Pet Toxic is a reference application designed to help pet owners identify substances that may be harmful to their pets. We are committed to protecting your privacy.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>Pet Toxic does <strong>not</strong> directly collect, store, or transmit any personal information. The app operates entirely offline and does not require an account, login, or internet connection to access its database of toxic substances.</p>

    <h2>Data Stored on Your Device</h2>
    <p>The app stores the following data locally on your device only:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your saved/bookmarked articles</li>
        <li>Your recent search history</li>
        <li>Your display preferences (such as light/dark mode)</li>
        <li>Your purchase status (ad-free upgrade)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This data never leaves your device and is not accessible to us or any third party. You can clear this data at any time by deleting the app.</p>

    <h2>Advertising</h2>
    <p>The free version of Pet Toxic displays advertisements provided by third-party ad networks. These services may collect certain information automatically, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Device identifiers</li>
        <li>General location (city/region level)</li>
        <li>App usage and ad interaction data</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This information is used to serve relevant advertisements and is governed by the ad provider's privacy policy. We do not have access to or control over the data collected by these third-party services.</p>
    <p><strong>Ad-Free Option:</strong> Users may purchase an ad-free upgrade through the App Store. Once purchased, no advertisements are displayed and no ad-related data collection occurs.</p>

    <h2>In-App Purchases</h2>
    <p>Pet Toxic offers an optional in-app purchase to remove advertisements. These transactions are processed entirely by Apple through the App Store. We do not collect or have access to your payment information.</p>

    <h2>External Links</h2>
    <p>The app provides phone numbers for poison control hotlines. When you tap these numbers, your device's phone app will open. These calls are handled entirely by your device and carrier.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Pet Toxic does not knowingly collect personal information from anyone, including children under 13. The third-party ad networks used in the free version may have their own policies regarding children's data.</p>

    <p>If you have questions about this privacy policy, please contact us at:<br>
