    <h1>Privacy Policy for Pet Toxic</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last updated: February 11, 2026</p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Pet Toxic is a reference application designed to help pet owners identify substances that may be harmful to their pets. We are committed to protecting your privacy.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>Pet Toxic does <strong>not</strong> directly collect, store, or transmit any personal information. The app's toxicity database, medical glossary, and lab work reference guide are all bundled within the app and operate entirely offline. The app does not require an account, login, or internet connection to access its content.</p>

    <h2>Data Stored on Your Device</h2>
    <p>The app stores the following data locally on your device only:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your saved/bookmarked articles</li>
        <li>Your recent search history</li>
        <li>Your display preferences (such as light/dark mode)</li>
        <li>Your purchase status (free, Pro, or Supporter tier)</li>
        <li>Pet profiles you create (including pet name, species, breed, weight, date of birth, and optional photo)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This data is stored entirely on your device and is never transmitted to us or any third party. We do not have access to any of this information. You can clear all app data at any time by deleting the app.</p>

    <h2>In-App Purchases</h2>
    <p>Pet Toxic offers optional in-app purchases to unlock additional features:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Pro ($9.99):</strong> Unlocks My Pets profiles, the Medical Glossary, and the Lab Work Guide.</li>
        <li><strong>Supporter ($14.99):</strong> Includes everything in Pro, plus a supporter badge. A portion of proceeds supports local animal shelters and rescues.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>All transactions are processed entirely by Apple through the App Store. We do not collect or have access to your payment information.</p>

    <h2>External Links</h2>
    <p>The app provides phone numbers for poison control hotlines. When you tap these numbers, your device's phone app will open. These calls are handled entirely by your device and carrier.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Pet Toxic does not knowingly collect personal information from anyone, including children under 13.</p>
